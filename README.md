## What Is This?

A unified electromagnetic framework that reconciles Maxwell's field equations with the working vocabulary of the electrical trades. Built on the Poynting Vector lifecycle — not the drift-velocity fiction.

The theory establishes **eight Constitutional Laws** (Laws 0–VIII) governing how electromagnetic energy is conceived, transported, harvested, and returned in every circuit on Earth.

> *"The Law came first, all other things are governed by law. Remove matter and you are still left with law."*

| [Visual Proof — The Conception](Visual-Proof-The-Conception.pdf) | Where E and H are born in Unity — the origin of the Poynting Vector at the alternator stator, pulse by pulse. |

## The Eight Laws

| Law | Name | Principle |
|-----|------|-----------|
| **0** | The Mandate (Magnetic Reciprocity) | H must return to the source after E is harvested. The universe keeps strict books. |
| **I** | Creation (Transverse Initiation) | The Poynting Vector maintains full potentiality until E is harvested. |
| **II** | Division (Branching Integrity) | E may distribute across branches; H is never destroyed. |
| **III** | Harvest (Electrical Exhaustion) | Sum of voltage drops equals initial potential. H stands widowed but undiminished. |
| **IV** | The Saboteur (Self-Inductive Inversion) | Inductors force H into geometric self-opposition. 90° temporal offset. |
| **V** | The Repeller (Dielectric Suspension) | Capacitors reflect H at the dielectric boundary. 270° recoil echo. |
| **VI** | Flux-Field Scaling (The Ratio Law) | Transformer turns ratio redistributes H and E. Total Poynting flux conserved. |
| **VII** | Field Unity & Dis-Unity (The Coupling Law) | E and H conceived in Unity. Harvest only possible in Unity. Echo Cancellation restores it. |
| **VIII** | Dimensional Prohibition (The Asymmetry Law) | E is temporal, H is spatial. H cannot oppose E. This is the architecture of the universe. |
